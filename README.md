## Sales Forecasting Project Using Python

This is a sales forecasting project designed as an easily reusable template. This project showcases the application of various predictive modeling techniques for accurate weekly sales forecasting, leveraging Python's powerful data science libraries.


### Overview

This template demonstrates how to:

- Predict weekly sales using time series analysis.
- Incorporate external factors such as Digital Ads, Offline Ads, TV commercials (TVCM), and Print Media into forecasting models.
- Compare the performance of multiple forecasting models including Linear Regression, Prophet, LightGBM, and SARIMAX.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes:

- **Minimum Requirements:**
  - At least 2 years of weekly sales data.
  - Future data points for external factors such as Digital Ads, Offline Ads, TVCM, and Print Media.

- Weekly Sales data.
- External advertising metrics:
  - Digital Ads
  - Offline Ads
  - TVCM (Gross Rating Points)
  - Print Media spend

All data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistency and accuracy for modeling purposes.

### Modeling Techniques

The following forecasting methods have been compared:

- **Linear Regression (OLS)**:

  - Captures basic relationships between sales and external regressors.

- **Prophet**:

  - A Facebook-developed forecasting model specialized for handling time series with strong seasonal effects and external regressors.

- **LightGBM**:

  - A machine learning-based model that handles complex non-linear relationships and interactions between predictors efficiently.

- **SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with external regressors)**:

  - Combines traditional ARIMA modeling with external regressors, explicitly capturing both seasonal patterns and external influences.

### Performance Comparison

Each model is evaluated using the following standard forecasting metrics:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:
  - Measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted and actual values, penalizing larger errors significantly.

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:
  - Provides the average absolute deviation between predicted and actual values, giving a clear view of typical prediction errors.

- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**:
  - Indicates the average percentage deviation, offering a normalized measure of accuracy that is easy to interpret across different scales.

### Benchmarking and Model Selection

Each model's performance is compared against benchmarks such as simple historical averages or basic linear regression. Detailed evaluations include:

- **Benchmark Comparisons:**
  - Models are benchmarked to determine incremental performance gains from advanced modeling techniques compared to simpler methods.

- **Detailed Visualizations:**
  - Clear visual presentations of forecasts versus actuals, helping users intuitively assess model performance.

- **Insightful Analysis:**
  - Provides recommendations on selecting the optimal model based on accuracy, complexity, and interpretability, allowing users to confidently identify the best-performing approach for their specific forecasting tasks.
